	-The only symbols that should be accessable to collections are its own symbols, and those
	that are specifically declared "global" (which can only be done at program-level).

	-make block-structured calling convention

Virtual Machine to-do list:
	-Implement new instructions for bit shifting
	-Seperate stack for activation records. Eesk should be more block-structured.
	-switch from loc/dloc-ing all the fucking time to always using real addresses

	-keep making header files to link the standard C library.
