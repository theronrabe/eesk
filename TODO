Compiler to-do list:
	-characters currently consume a full 64-bit word. They should only each consume one byte.
		-This should be done not only to preserve memory, but also to keep strings consistent with C strings.
	-Accommodate new instruction for turning MEM indices into absolute addresses in compiler.h (LOC)
	-Write LOC instructions whenever a pointer is pushed (and not immediately CONTed) when nativeFlag is raised.

Virtual Machine to-do list:
	-Rewrite character operations to still work on new character size.
	-Implement new instruction for turning MEM indices into absolute addresses (LOC)

Eesk Environment to-do list:
	-choose a file extension for Eesk header files
	-make header files to link the standard C library.
