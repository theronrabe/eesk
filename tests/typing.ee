#How might a type stack help?
	#All Sets are values
	#Few values are Sets
	#Value operators (+, -, *, /, %, etc.) change type to value
	#$ operator could indicate Set or value when used. Solution?
		#each user-symbol's space could have an extra word of type
		#when symbol is assigned, it takes type of top of typestack
		#when symbol is again encountered, it places most recent type on typestack
		#$ has no effect on typestack
	#[] behavior depends on top of typestack
{
	Set asdf {x} {prints "here\n"; x$}
Begin
	#3 []
	#1 2 3 [End]
	#asdf [ asdf [ asdf [End 100] ] ]
	asdf [1 2 3]
	#test []
	#asdf
	#(1 + 2) [] ^
	#notASet []
	#1 + asdf; []
	#100 []
	#setPointer$ []
}
#activationStack requires its own typestack

#Type stack instructions:
	#-	pushType	whenever a term is explicitly stacked
	#-	popType		clears top of typeStack
	#-	symType		places symbol's type on typeStack
	#-	typeof		reads (pops) type from typestack
	#data operators change top of typestack
	#-	check top of typestack in [] assembly
	#assign type to symbol upon = operator
		#what about assignments to dynamic memory? How is type stored?
	
	#Operators that affect type:
		#+-*/%
		#^ : ...
		#= =>
		#== < > & | !
