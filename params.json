{"name":"Eesk","tagline":"The unsafe programming language","body":"### What is Eesk?\r\nEesk is an open source (GPL) programming language that doesn't exchange expressiveness for safety, and doesn't attempt to hide its underlying mechanics. Eesk aims to empower programmers by never preventing them from doing wrong things.\r\n\r\nThe Eesk programming language is supported by the ee compiler and eesk virtual machine found in the repository. This software has only been tested on 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 (with regular updates).\r\n\r\n### Begin Eesking\r\nTo install the language's supporting software, download the repository (by either using a link from above, or the first command below) and compile the source in the following way:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/theronrabe/eesk.git\r\n$ cd <eesk>/compiler;make\r\n$ cd ../vm; make\r\n```\r\nThe included manual file contains a comprehensive documentation of Eesk.\r\n\r\n### How to contribute to Eesk\r\nUse the language. Try it for your next project. If things go smoothly, then keep using it. If not, contact me through github (@theronrabe), and I'll make it better for the next person.
